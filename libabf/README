LibABF

LibABF is the library responsible for encoding and decoding Audio books in our format.
This library is the foundation library for the format as such and should be considered the reference implementation.
As of now, encoding is single-threaded, meaning that encoding takes a bit of time.
We have started work on making encoding multi-threaded, thereby we should take a little shorter if the book consists of many files, which is typically the idea behind Daisy 2.02 books.
