DECODER

README

This is a simple decoder. Currently, this decoder is only for Daisy 2.02 books. However, I plan to make an interface to this library more generic.
This could be done by:
* Providing common functions in the library interface
* Make the other functions virtual
Currently, the plan is just to make a small decoder that can save the audio to a wave file. All the audio of a daisy book, I might add.
