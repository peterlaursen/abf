IN_ABF.DLL
Copyright (C) 2009-2015 Peter Laursen.

This is a Winamp plugin for ABF. At first, it'll just allow playback of ABF Audio Files - no navigation will be supported.

The supported format is ABF 2.1.

Build notes:

Build the library with libabf.cpp linked statically. We ensure that the libraries are automatically included.
