FIREFOX PLUGIN

OVERVIEW:

ABF is currently not able to be streamed by a browser. In order for this thing to work, we must develop a firefox plugin.

This also means that we must develop a plugin and that it must compile on Windows, Unix and Linux.

We start with a Firefox plugin because the information we need is readily available, both documentation and header files.

REQUIREMENTS:

The users need at least Firefox 3.5, since our development version of Firefox corresponds to this. No support is offered for other browser versions.

The users also need to run a supported operating system. I'll provide binaries for Ubuntu, FreeBSD and Windows.
