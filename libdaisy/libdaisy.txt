LIBDAISY

A SIMPLE DESIGN DOCUMENT:

LibDaisy contains the classes and functions for working with Daisy 2.02 books. The functions we are to use are currently scattered throughout the programs we have developed so far. It is our job to get a hold of these functions and combine them into a shared library. This has been done with the invention of LibDaisy.
It is also our goal to create a .NET interface - still not done. The library is to be re-designed anyway.
The rest of this document was woefully out of date - therefore, it has been scrapped.

Problems with LibDaisy:

Over the course of the development of ABF, LibDaisy has had a lot of bugs compared to the rest of the code. It has, historically, introduced many bugs to the converter. Character encoding has also shown itwelf to cause problems.

Therefore, a new design of this library is imperative.
