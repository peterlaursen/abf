LIBDAISY

README

This library contains all the "common" functions for extracting information from Daisy books.
It will take functions from daisyinfo and smilextract and then they will be linked together to form some executables. Their API will have to be documented, of course.

As of this writing, SmilExtracts functions are already finished as far as I know. I'll have to put them and the important functions from DaisyInfo into classes and put them into the ABF namespace.
