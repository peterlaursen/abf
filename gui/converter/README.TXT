This folder contains a graphical user interface for the converter. It is currently only written as a .NET user interface, using C++ as a language.

The GUI does not use project files - it is expected (as of yet) it is manually compiled. Instructions will be provided later.

A first draft of the GUI was finished more quickly than I had expected. The structure has been pretty clear from the start, have as much as possible in menus rather than buttons.

There is still plenty left to be done:

1) Make the "DAISY Book..." menu item work.
2) Allow the user to type in the title, author and estimated time of the audio book.
3) Allow the user to choose where the file shall be stored.
4) Show status of conversion and make the conversion take place in a separate thread.
