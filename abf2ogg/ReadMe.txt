Abf2Ogg

This program allows you to convert ABF audio books to Ogg files.

This is only a very basic draft program and it is currently dependant on having oggenc present - this program is available from xiph.org.

When the program has received some more developing, it'll be possible for it to decode the ABF book section by section so that one gets a folder containing OGG files.

It is noted (with a certain glee) that the OGG file takes up more room than the corresponding ABF book.
