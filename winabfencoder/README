LibABF

LibABF is the library responsible for encoding and decoding Audio books in our format.
This library is the foundation library for the format as such and should be considered the reference implementation.
As of now, encoding is single-threaded, meaning that encoding takes a bit of time.

After long deliberations, it has been decided to keep the original LibABF API and extend it to allow more control over the encoding process.
This will be done by adding a few functions to the libabf.h AbfEncoder class.
Decoding should be unaffected.

As of this writing, libabfmulti has been retired.
